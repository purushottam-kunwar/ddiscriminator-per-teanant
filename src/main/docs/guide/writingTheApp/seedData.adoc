To setup some test data you can modify the `Application` class to implement the `ApplicationRunner` interface to run transactional logic on startup:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/example/Application.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/init/example/Application.groovy[]
----

<1> Implement the `ApplicationRunner` interface
<2> Mark the `run` method as transactional with `@Transactional`
<3> Use `saveAll` to save two `Manufacturer` instances

In the example about two `Manufacturer` instances are saved that will correspond
to the two tenants supported by this application.
